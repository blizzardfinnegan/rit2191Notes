CHMG-145-01
Chemistry 1 Lab
Professor: Unknown
Semester: 2191 (2019 Fall)
Time Slot: Unknown

This course is very particular. If you do not do everything as though you are, yourself, a professional lifelong chemist, on the verge of discovering something lifechanging, even though all labs are pre-"scripted", and every result is calculated in some way beforehand. The lab must be completely and totally written before reporting to the calculations. A calculator is also mandatory in the lab at all times.
A lab coat and goggles are also required, and they must be purchased from RIT well before first class, or obtained by some other fashion before the lab. A composition notebook is also required, and will be regularly checked to ensure that it is being filled out properly. 
Aside from the militaristic style of the class, the course is rather boring, with nothing interesting really happening, other than colors changing or temperatures rising or falling. Only take Chemistry if you must for some requirement.
